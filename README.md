# assimp-sys
Autogenerated Rust bindings for the [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) library.

This is meant to complement [`russimp`](https://github.com/jkvargas/russimp) which will hopefully be
renamed to `assimp` once we figure out how to contact the [original author](https://github.com/Eljay)
of both crates which have't been updated in three years as of this writing (23. Feb. 2021) but are
holding the resp. names hostage on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
